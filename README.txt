go to chrome://serviceworker-internals and scroll down to 'Scope: chrome-extension://gndmhdcefbhlchkhipcnnbkcmicncehk/'
press start, then inspect (or just inspect if it's already activated) and paste the code.

if an error message pops up, scroll down to a different section and try it there instead.
